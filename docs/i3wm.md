# i3wm

i3wm is a tiling window manager. This means that it positions windows on the screens by subdividing the space horizontally or vertically and draws the windows borders. There are several tiling window managers available for linux, such as Qtile or awesome, but I use i3wm becasue why not.

## Configuration

The configuration file of i3wm is [.i3/config](../i3/config)
