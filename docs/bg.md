# Background story

This is the abridged story of why and how I settled with the current configuration represented by my [dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/langurmonkey/dotfiles) repository.

**TLDR**; I like elegant and streamlined solutions. Traditional floating window managers and desktop environments are neither elegant nor streamlined at core. Tiled window managers are. Pull the thread.

I am a long-time Linux user. During all my years using Linux, I distro-hopped several times. I started with Red Hat, then jumped to Mandrake (before the fusion that produced Mandriva, which I never used), then to Ubuntu and back to Mandrake. Then Fedora. I also tried Mint and Manjaro and finally settled with Antergos. Right now I use Antergos in all my personal machines, and Ubuntu at work (due to reasons that are out of my hands).

I also tried a bunch of desktop environments. Gnome 2, Gnome Shell, KDE and KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, Mate, Budgie, Xfce (which I used for a long time), you name it. I never felt at home in any of these. All of them feel bloated and not very elegant and installed far too many packages by default which I never used. 

I like the concept of tiling window managers a lot and I think most developers should use one. They help make the most of the available space and organise windows in a logical and hassle-free way. Furthermore, you never really need to leave the keyboard if you don't want to, which is a big plus. For these reasons, I ended settling down with `i3wm`, and this repository started growing a lot (before it only had `vim` and `tmux` dotfiles). Right now, I can basically run the bootstrap script in new machine, deploy it and the environment is for the most part ready to go.
